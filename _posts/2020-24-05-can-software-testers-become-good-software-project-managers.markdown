It is a common notion that web engineers prove to be the best project managers. My write-up talks about how anyone who wants to tweak their career path to be a PM, totally and completely CAN!

First things first, who has the capability to become a successful project manager? Can software testers be able to software project managers? 
The answer, in my opinion, is a solid YES. 

Normally, a good software tester has a thorough knowledge of software product requirements. A QA specialist will have an easier time switching to a new software product.

Good software testers also understand software development methodologies inside out. Software QA personnel categorize every element as a process or procedure. This could ensure that things are done the right way.

Nonetheless, if you are a quality assurance engineer, you are more likely to transition into product management or business development.

<h2>Qualities Of Software Tester Justifying The Role Of Project Managers: </h2>

<h7 style= "color: #9900ff;"> They are good decision makers </h7>

A single minor decision taken incorrectly can endanger the entire project. The work of a software tester should be suited for fast thinking and decisive responses.

Good decision-making ability is a key trait required to be displayed by a project manager.

<h7 style= "color: #9900ff;">They are great problem solvers!</h7>

A software tester is an individual who knows what is better for the end-client. A tester himself uses the software product a number of times while testing it, and is the individual who can state what is done advantageously. 

<h7 style= "color: #9900ff;">Software testers display honesty towards their work. </h7>

Project management or leadership refers to a collection of values, commitment to genuineness, and alignment with colleagues. 

Honesty indicates that successful software project managers assume responsibility for setting high standards for themselves and their team. It is their duty to honour these standards and reward teammates who do the same.

My stance remains that testers are driven by self-interest and leadership qualities and may prove to be a good fit in project manager roles.


<h4 style= "color: #9900ff;">Key Takeaways:</h4>

I hope that I have clearly justified my opinion: the roles and responsibilities of a PM and the qualities of a good tester are very similar. Software testers too, can become successful project managers, if we go by this school of thought. It is important for the right opportunities to come by for every QA specialist. I hope we, as an industry, are instrumental in making these radical and much-needed changes.
