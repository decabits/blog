With the boom in a number of mobile app development companies, developing an app seems to be a cakewalk. All you need is to contact an app development agency and the rest is taken care of by them.
But are you assured of a flawless product at the end of the development process?

Therefore, it is advisable to get involved in app development, right from the stage when the app blueprint is prepared: that is UI/UX design.
UI and UX designing is the most significant aspects of the mobile experience. They need to be absolutely spot on.

With great user experience, the growth of an app can increase exponentially. In this blog, we will be focusing on Mobile UI and UX design mistakes one should avoid at any cost. 

<ol>
<li>Substandard Design: App design begins with ideas from the UI and UX designers. The UX designers are responsible for enhancing the user experience and the UI designers take care of the placement of elements. Once the ideas from both are blended, there is a significant chance of mismatch of perspective.
 
The untidy layout can kill user experience and can lead to many problems in the future. Hence, it’s crucial that both the designing team and the development team should be in sync and give enough input to each other.

<li>
Remove non-essential features: Every developer tries his best to create an ultimate app and for that, features matter the most. But sometimes, the app is bombarded with unnecessary features, which reduces the app performance. It is necessary for app designers to figure out what all features are required and should be integrated into the app.

<li>
Unclear CTAs: ‘Call To Action’ or CTA is an important component for advertising and selling. It conveys to the user what needs to be done next. Apps with clear CTAs have higher chances of engagement as compared to apps that don’t. For example, checkout <a href="http://www.decabits.com">Decabits</a>, the navbar on this site consists of a tab for - "book a meeting"- it's the most classic example for CTA. The app designers should focus on the following parameters of a CTA:
<ul>
<li> Color</li>
<li> Design</li>
<li> Shape </li>
<li> Size </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>

Unresponsive Design: It’s essential that the user experience of an app should always remain consistent and always match up with the user’s interests. The app must give the desired response to the users. 

</li>

<li>

Low Page Speed: The page speed of a mobile app matters a lot. Images and other graphic design elements must be compressed so that they don’t affect app load time. Page speed impacts the mobile app ranking in mobile play stores.
