<h1>7 reasons why you should invest in web development for your business success!</h1>

<p>After being in this industry for so long - observing & researching for more than that, there is a list of things I have realized. Beginning with the most basics- technology & digital has become the aesthetics & core of how this world works. No exaggeration, but like most things, our life will be halfway down with the lack of digital connectivity. It’s key to a socially active life & makes up for major networking in recent times.</p>


<p>If you are an entrepreneur, industrialist or a new age business startup, here is a list of principal reasons why your first & key investment should begin with a website.</p>


<h3>1. A good website represents your business maturity.</h3>

<p>If you are thinking you can work with the word of mouth, your name & reputation- of course, you can but for a scalable business & new clients to give you importance, your website is a portfolio you need to build. After having dealt with a number of clients & reaching out to leads, one thing that’s common to all is their requirement for your website URL. They can see the maturity & level of your business. They would like to see your team size & the fact of how serious is your business venture. A mainstream website made with Wordpress and similars, with not many components to play with, mostly act as a major turn off to some potential customers. So, displaying the credibility of your trade is foremost!</p>


<h3>2. If you have a product-based company, your business will be on a roll 24*7</h3>

<p>Well, you have to second me on this, day/night your business never closes down if you are up & running on the browsers. A cart functionality, a transaction process & you are earning out of your homes. If it’s a small business, don’t even invest in an office. Just make the internet your office with a website handling all client queries & make revenue just like you thought.</p>



<h3>3. You are not confined to an area for reaching & expanding!</h3>


<p>With a cool website, you are bound to get clients from far & wide, this is more applicable to service-based companies. Auditing companies/digital-marketing/business-development firms can provide their services to clients even abroad. Products like shoes, makeup, jewellery can be shipped worldwide with the demand reaching out of your area. There are so many Indian startups that have client base out of the US, UK & Australia like<ahref="https://decabits.com">decabits</a>, capturing outdoor markets too.</p>



<h3>4. You can keep a track of money/admin & all other databases</h3>


<p>When you get a customized website done, you can even integrate admin panels to your website for keeping a tab of the incoming money as well as your employee panels for storing other information. All in all, your website becomes your go-to place for everything you need to check for your business. Am I right or am I right?</p>


<h3>5. Generates quality leads</h3>


<p>Who likes a stagnant business with no new clients & leads? With a good website, you can apply the robust SEO strategies to generate quality leads to reach out to. With good & tailored platforms, any new user who scrolls through your website or may be interested in your business may even fill a form to directly reach out to you. Analytics & marketing just becomes a whole new world with lovely & rich websites to rely on. Aid them with the efficiency of digital marketing!</p>



<h3>6. Security issues</h3>

<p>If you already have a website that you instantly created just for entering the digital world, there is this major reason why you should invest in professional web development. Old sites that are going on for so long may have weaker security with lots of unwanted scripts, plugins & whatnot. Your site will become outdated before you know. So before someone starts to hack it, safeguard!</p>


<h3>7. User-friendliness MATTERS</h3>


<p>Last but one of the most imperative points, no matter how much you deny it,  a user-friendly site is basically the avenue to sprinting success. It can make or break your brand in a flash and whatnot. Investing in a team of web developers can fetch you loads as you go beyond the built-in templates. After researching for years, following a pattern for so long & looking out at different websites is the non-mainstream feature that gives your trade an edge.</p>


<p>So before you start looking out for clients, make sure you first hire developers to code that site for you to begin with & surely thank me later.</p>
